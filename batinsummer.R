#---- State (fat reserves) ---- 
# Defining state variables. Fat reserves are important as they determine hunting efficiency.
#There is a negative feedback loop here, as fatter bats will be able to hunt less.

m_0    <- 10    # Mass of bat with zero fat reserves (g)
x_max  <- 2.4   # Maximum fat reserves (g)
                
x_d    <- seq(from = 0, to = x_max, 
              length.out=100)   # Discretized values of x


#---- Actions (costs and rewards) ---- 
# Defining decision-related variables.
# Bats can choose between a maximum of three actions: forage, roost (no torpor), roost (torpor).
# These are coded as i = [1, 2, 3] 
# Each patch (H[i]) has a different energy cost denoted by mu (due to metabolism).
# Each patch also has a different energetic gain denoted by e (in practice only the foraging patch leads to an energetic gain).

mu <- c(0, 0.001, 0.005)  # Basic daily predation risk per patch (/day) 
e  <- c(0, 0.6, 2.0)      # Net daily forage inntake for patch 1/2 (g/day)

#The following value is to be changed
lambda <- 0.46     # Increase in predation risk due to body mass (/g fat reserves)

# The metabolic costs per day are also mass-dependent, equal to gamma * (m0 * x), 
# where m0 is the mass of the bat with zero fat reserves (defined above)

#The following value is to be changed
gamma  <- 0.04     # Metabolic rate (g/day)


#---- Fitness (time, probability of good or bad night)---- 
# Summer consists of 153 days (Days) and each day is divided into 48 time steps (Time). 
# We can account for this with a nested loop (see backwards iteration below). 
# Environmental stochasticity arises from daily metabolic costs. 
# A bad day has a higher metabolic costs (c_b) and occurs with probability p_b
# A good day has a lower metabolic cost (c_g) and occurs with probability 1-p_b

Time <- 72    # Number of time periods per day (where time+1 is the beginning of daytime) - eventually use 70
Days <- 153   # Number of days in summer (where days+1 is the start of winter)
c_g  <- 0.48  # Metabolic cost of a good day (g)
c_b  <- 1.20  # Metabolic cost of a bad day (g)
p_b  <- 0.167 # Probability of a bad day

# Recall that terminal fitness is the probability of surviving the summer (i.e. d+1)
# We can calculate it using equation 5.1 in C&M

# First, an empty array to hold fitness values from the loop
Fit<- array(data = NA, dim = c(length(x_d), Time+1, Days), 
             dimnames = list(x_d, 1:(Time+1), 1:(Days)) )

# Calculate terminal fitness F(x, t+1, d) where x=state 
for (j in 1:length(x_d)) {
  # Note: I use j as the index of an x-value in x_d and x 
  # as the value of x_d[j].
  x <- x_d[j]
  # If your state does not allow you to survive a good day,
  # survival is impossible and your fitness is zero. 
  if (x < c_g) {
    Fit[j, Time+1, Days] <- 0
  # If your state allows you to survive a good day, but not a bad one,
  # you survive with probability p_g=1-p_b (the probability of a good night). 
  } else if (x < c_b) {
    Fit[j, Time+1, Days] <- (1-p_b)
  # If your state allows you to survive a bad day, you will always survive
  # i.e. your probability of survival is 1. 
  } else {
    Fit[j, Time+1, Days] <- 1
  } # end if-else loop
} # end for loop

#taking a look at the
#as.matrix(Fit[, Time+1, Days])

# The left column shows state, the right column shows the terminal fitness we just calculated. 
# To survive a good day requires 0.48 g of fat reserves.
# When x < 0.48 the bat dies (it cannot survive the best-case scenario). 
# To survive a bad day requires 1.2 g of fat reserves. 
# When 0.48 < x < 1.2 the probability of survival =  1-p_b = 0.833
# When x > 1.2 (the cost of a bad day), the bird always survives (probability =1)

#---- Discrete state variable (interpolation function) ----
# The computer discretizes the state variable 
# but in reality energetic reserves is a continuous variable. 
# We overcome this using interpolation (see C&M 2.1)

  linear_interpolation <- function (a, b, dx) {

  # Bird is dead.

  # 0: Closer to x_d[j1]
