#---- State ---- 
# Defining state variables. Fat reserves are important as they determine hunting efficiency.
#There is a negative feedback loop here, as fatter bats will be able to hunt less.

m_0    <- 10    # Mass of bat with zero fat reserves (g)
x_max  <- 6   # Maximum fat reserves (g)
                
x_d    <- seq(from = 0, to = x_max, 
              length.out=100)   # Discretized values of x


#---- Actions ---- 
# Defining decision-related variables.
# Bats can choose between a maximum of three actions: forage, roost (no torpor), roost (torpor).
# These are coded as i = [1, 2, 3] 
# Each patch (H[i]) has a different energy cost denoted by mu (due to metabolism).
# Each patch also has a different energetic gain denoted by e (in practice only the foraging patch leads to an energetic gain).
# The bird code included predation, but in bats energy cost is likely to be a stronger influence on decisions.

mu <- c(0.0005, 0.0002, 0.0001)  # Basic daily metabolic cost per patch (/day) 
e  <- c(0, 0.6, 0.6)      # Net daily forage intake for patch 1/2 (g/day)

lambda <- 0.06     # Decrease in hunting efficiency with body mass (/g fat reserves)

# The metabolic costs per day are also mass-dependent, equal to gamma * (m0 * x), 
# where m0 is the mass of the bat with zero fat reserves (defined above)

gamma  <- 0.04     # Metabolic rate (g/day)



#---- Fitness ---- 
# Summer consists of 120 days (Days) and each day is divided into 50 time steps (Time). 
# We can account for this with a nested loop (see backwards iteration below). 
# Environmental stochasticity arises from daily metabolic costs. 
# A bad day has a higher metabolic costs (c_b) and occurs with probability p_b
# A good day has a lower metabolic cost (c_g) and occurs with probability 1-p_b

Time <- 50    # Number of time periods per day (where time+1 is the beginning of daytime)
Days <- 120   # Number of days in summer (where days+1 is the start of winter)
c_g  <- 0.48  # Metabolic cost of a good day (g)
c_b  <- 1.20  # Metabolic cost of a bad day (g)
p_b  <- 0.167 # Probability of a bad day

# We generate a calendar array that will code for days when torpor is or is not available.
# Make vector of length Days, fill it with 3s
calendar <- c(rep(3, times=Days))
# Then overwrite these for days 70 to 90
# We create the following variables to make it easier to change these later
no_torpor_start <- 70
no_torpor_end <- 80
calendar[no_torpor_start:no_torpor_end] <- c(2)

# Recall that terminal fitness is the probability of surviving the summer (i.e. d+1)
# We can calculate it using equation 5.1 in C&M

# First, an empty array to hold fitness values from the loop
Fit<- array(data = NA, dim = c(length(x_d), Time+1, Days), 
             dimnames = list(x_d, 1:(Time+1), 1:(Days)) )

# Calculate terminal fitness F(x, t+1, d) where x=state 
for (j in 1:length(x_d)) {
  # Note: I use j as the index of an x-value in x_d and x 
  # as the value of x_d[j].
  x <- x_d[j]
  # If your state does not allow you to survive a good day,
  # survival is impossible and your fitness is zero. 
  if (x < c_g) {
    Fit[j, Time+1, Days] <- 0
  # If your state allows you to survive a good day, but not a bad one,
  # you survive with probability p_g=1-p_b (the probability of a good night). 
  } else if (x < c_b) {
    Fit[j, Time+1, Days] <- (1-p_b)
  # If your state allows you to survive a bad day, you will always survive
  # i.e. your probability of survival is 1. 
  } else {
    Fit[j, Time+1, Days] <- 1
  } # end if-else loop
} # end for loop

as.matrix(Fit[, Time+1, Days])
# The left column shows state, the right column shows the terminal fitness we just calculated. 
# To survive a good day requires 0.48 g of fat reserves.
# When x < 0.48 the bat dies (it cannot survive the best-case scenario). 
# To survive a bad day requires 1.2 g of fat reserves. 
# When 0.48 < x < 1.2 the probability of survival =  1-p_b = 0.833
# When x > 1.2 (the cost of a bad day), the bird always survives (probability =1)

#---- Discrete state variable ----
# The computer discretizes the state variable 
# but in reality energetic reserves is a continuous variable. 
# We overcome this using interpolation (see C&M 2.1)

interpolate <- function (x, t, d) {
  
  # Returns the index of the closest discrete x value

    # equidistant values.

  }
  
  # Interpolate between two values a and b. dx is a value between 0 and 1.
  linear_interpolation <- function (a, b, dx) {
    return((1-dx)*a+ b*dx)
  }
  
  # No point in doing interpolation if energy reserves are negative.
  # Bird is dead.
  if (x < 0) { return(0) }
  
  # Figure out between which two discretized values of x our x lies.

    j1 <- closest -1
    j2 <- closest
  } else if (x > x_d[closest]){
    j1 <- closest

  }

  else { return( Fit[closest, t, d]) }
  
  # Calculate how x is positioned in relation to x_d[j1] and x_d[j2].
  # 0: Closer to x_d[j1]
  # 1: Closer to x_d[j2]

  # Interpolate.
  return(linear_interpolation(Fit[j1, t, d], Fit[j2, t, d], delta_x))
